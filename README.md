## Overview
A simple mod that adds two tools (Hammers and Impact Hammers) and a single block, Dust. 

Hammers are used to break blocks down into their baser forms, so **Cobblestone becomes Gravel**, **Gravel becomes Dirt**, **Dirt becomes Sand** et cetera. 
Impact Hammers are pickaxes that can mine in a 3x3 or 4x4 radius depending on the tool tier. 

Both of these tools are completely customisable in the configuration file, which should be located at `.minecraft/config/simplehammers.json`

On it's own this mod doesn't really do a whole lot, as it's intended for usage in modpacks, where resources might be configured to be scarce. Pack developers can integrate this mod as an alternative resource gathering solution
